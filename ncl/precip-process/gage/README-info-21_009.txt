NCEP/EMC U.S. Precipitation Ancillary Station List
https://data.eol.ucar.edu/dataset/21.009

Summary
This data file contains the station information for the National Centers for
Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) Gage
Datasets. This dataset is provided as is and in its original format.

Identifiers
 * Local archive identifier: 21.009
 * doi:10.26023/N2G2-3QF6-0G08
   https://doi.org/10.26023/N2G2-3QF6-0G08

Versions
  1.0
  1.1: This version contains two files: the first is a directory of HADS Data
Collection Platforms (DCP -http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hads/) sites, the
second is NWS Location Identifiers. A good portion of sites on either
list might not be gauge sites, but probably all gauges can be found on
at least one of them. The shapefile will need to be extract from the
zipfile by users. When they add they can symbolize using Gridcode field.
